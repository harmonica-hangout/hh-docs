# Harp Academy

Harp Academy was Harmonica Hangout's attempt to create a rough guideline
for users to follow in their journey to learn harmonica. It was shuttered
due to the subjective nature of skill level and the workload of having
to grade others. It was replaced with a self-serve role system on the 
honor system.

Below is the content from each channel in order:

## Join Harp Academy

**Harp Academy**

Learn how to play the harmonica and earn roles as you learn various skills and progress from beginner to expert; you'll also gain access to read our teacher directory for private lessons.

**This is supposed to be a fun, guided approach to learning Harmonica and activity for members to partake in.
At the top of each harp academy channel will be an estimated time commitment, but you get out of it what you put in, and each person will be different. If you're serious about advancing, get private lessons with a teacher!**

To join:

**1)** You'll need the Middle Walters role, this unlocks after 24+ hours depending on your activity.
**2)** Own a 10 hole diatonic harmonica.
**3)** Post a photo of your harmonica, introduce yourself if you haven't already, and let us know you'd like to join #üè´-harp-academy in #üõ§-harmonica-hangout

If you have done 1, 2 & 3 someone will give you a beginner role - *be patient*.
